1 What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

**Query #1**

    SELECT
      	customer_id, sum(price) as total_amount
    FROM dannys_diner.sales s
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
    ON m.product_id = s.product_id
    GROUP BY customer_id
    ORDER BY customer_id ;

| customer_id | total_amount |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | 76           |
| B           | 74           |
